## üîß **CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN YOUR API**

Based on the logs, I see these issues:

1. **YouTube Posts Error**: 
   ```
   ERROR: [youtube:tab] post: This channel does not have a UgkxeQMw3Ji9YT8y98gVNk2Q4ES2YO7hZ5DX tab
   ```
   - YouTube Community posts are not supported by yt-dlp
   - These are text/image posts, not videos

2. **Some Playlist URLs might need special handling**
3. **Long extraction times** for some content types

To improve YouTube support in your API:

1. **Better error handling** for unsupported content types

3. **Playlist handling** improvements for large playlists
4. **Live stream support** for ongoing broadcasts
